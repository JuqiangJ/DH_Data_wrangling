# What is data wrangling?

## Data analysis workflow

A common workflow for data analysis involves importing data, cleaning data, transforming data, visualizing and modeling data for reports or papers. 

If you have not worked with R before, you may use excel to do data cleaning and simple tranformation work with pivot tables and save the results in a new spreadsheet. You can also draw bar charts, pie charts and histrograms in the spreadsheet and save it as another spreadsheet. Then when you need to do more complex stats modeling like ANOVA or linear regression, you may import the spreadsheet into SPSS and other stats packages. 

Usually at the end of the project, you will find a number of .xsl or .csv files in your **data** folder. You may name them with the analysis you do or the data you generate them. But after six months, you may feel unsure about what is the meaning of the files, not to mention, others who may want to use it.

This issue involves lots of decision to be made in data management. But if you are using R, things can be easily because each manipulation of the data is recorded and fully reproducible.

## Data wrangling

Data wrangling (see the above figure in red box) involves some basic procedures (importing, tidying and transforming) in the early stage of data analysis. R,and relevant packages, *tidyverse* in particular, provide a number of functions that can help us dealing with data cleaning and tranformation. We will be learning how to use these functions in the follow sessions.
